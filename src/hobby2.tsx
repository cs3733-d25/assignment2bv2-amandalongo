            <p>
                Ballroom Dance is a broad genre of dance that includes multiple different styles.
                It is a type of social dancing and originated in Europe and the United States.
                It is typically danced with a partner pair that is split by leader and follower.
                There are overarching styles of ballroom dance, and within these styles, competitors compete in multiple dances.
