            <h1>Amanda's Nail Art</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Amanda, and I am a sophomore studying computer science with a minor in media art.</p>
            <p>One of my favorite hobbies is doing <b>nail art</b>! I use gel-x nails and I design press ons as well as
                doing my friends nails.
                Below is a compilation of photos that I took of nails I've done on myself or others.
                I like doing my own nails because it saves me money and I also love how they compliment my fashion and
                add to my overall style!</p>
